# Verilog_and_SV_Digital_Designs

Welcome to **Verilog_and_SV_Digital_Designs**, a collection of digital design projects created using Verilog and SystemVerilog. This repository is ideal for students, engineers, and enthusiasts who want to learn and implement RTL designs, simulations, and verification using hardware description languages.

## What You'll Find
- **RTL Designs**: Examples of combinational and sequential circuits.
- **Testbenches**: Verilog and SystemVerilog testbenches to help with simulation and verification.
- **Reusable Modules**: Modular and parameterized designs that can be used in various projects.
- **Clear Documentation**: Well-structured and easy-to-follow code.

## Who Is This For?
- **Beginners**: Get hands-on experience with Verilog and SystemVerilog through practical examples.
- **Professionals**: Access reusable modules and advanced designs for your projects.
- **Educators**: Use the designs as teaching materials for classes or workshops.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Verilog_and_SV_Digital_Designs.git
   ```
2. Explore the folders to find the design or module you need.
3. Use any HDL simulator (e.g., ModelSim, VCS, or Xilinx Vivado) to run the designs and testbenches.

## Tools and Requirements
- A Verilog/SystemVerilog Compiler (e.g., Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, Vivado)
- Basic knowledge of RTL design and simulation
